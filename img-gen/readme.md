# Greyscale image generator
This was originally based on a Stand-up Maths YouTube video ["How many different Youtube videos are possible?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yy_unGaD-w) and modified to work from my Blaseball color picker page.<br><br>
The page generates a single 128 x 128 greyscale image comprised of 16,384 6x6 pixels of a randomly generated greyscale color. You'll need to refresh the page if you want to gerenate a new image. Still needs some work to make it pretty but the core functionality is there so I'm not in a hurry to polish it.<br><br>
256 x 256 (as was the premise of the original video) takes much too long to generate and due to some HTML/CSS weirdness, I'm limited to a minimum pixel size of 6 and the image would end up being so big it can't fit on a standard 1920x1080 monitor.
